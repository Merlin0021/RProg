## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
#1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in
#Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.
```{r}
result_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

for (i in 0:4) {
  for (j in 0:4) {
    result_matrix[i + 1, j + 1] <- abs(i - j)
  }
}
print(result_matrix)
```
#2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown in Figure

```{r}
for(i in 1:5){
 cat(rep("*", i), "\n")
}
```
#3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.
```{r}
start_value <- 1

fib1 <- 0
fib2 <- 1

repeat {
  fib_next <- fib1 + fib2
  if (fib_next >= start_value) {
    cat(fib_next, "\n")
  }
  if (fib_next > 500) {
    break
  }
  
  fib1 <- fib2
  fib2 <- fib_next
}

```
#a. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of the dataset? Show your codes and its result
```{r}
ShoeSize <- read.csv("ShoeSize.csv")
ShoeSize
  
```
#b. Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in Male? How about in Female? Write the R scripts and its output.
```{r}
maleSubset <- subset(ShoeSize, Gender == "M")
femaleSubset <- subset(ShoeSize, Gender == "F")

numMale <- nrow(maleSubset)
numFemale <- nrow(femaleSubset)

cat("Number of Male observations:", numMale, "\n")
cat("Number of Female observations:", numFemale, "\n")
```
#c. Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(),chart type = barplot. Make sure to place title, legends, and colors. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}

genderCount <- c(Male = numMale, Female = numFemale)
barColors <- c("blue","pink")
SGender<-barplot(genderCount, main = "Number of Males and Females in the data", xlab = "Gender", ylab = "Count",col = barColors,legend = rownames(genderCount),beside = TRUE)
SGender
```
#5. The monthly income of Dela Cruz family was spent on the following:
```{r}
Food <- 60
Electricity <- 10
Savings <- 5
Miscellanous <- 25
delaCruz <- data.frame(Food, Electricity, Savings, Miscellanous)
delaCruz
  
```
#a. Create a piechart that will include labels in percentage.Add some colors and title of the chart. Write the R scripts and show its output.
```{r}
dela <-pie(c(Food, Electricity, Savings, Miscellanous), 
    labels = c("Food", "Electricity", "Savings", "Miscellanous"), 
    main = "Dela Cruz family monthly spending", 
    col = c("green", "blue", "pink", "yellow"),
    radius = 1)
dela
```
#6. Use the iris dataset.
```{r}
data(iris)
```
#a. Check for the structure of the dataset using the str() function. Describe what you have seen in the output.
```{r}
str(iris)
```
#It shows the data about the iris flower inlcuding the length and width of the petals and sepal. It also shows the species of the irises.

#b. Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length, sepal.width,petal.length,and petal.width. What is the R script and its result?
```{r}
lengthNwidth <- colMeans(iris[, 1:4])
lengthNwidth
```
#c. Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors. Write the R script and its result.
```{r}
speciesCounts <- table(iris$Species)

PieS <- pie(speciesCounts, 
    labels = paste(names(speciesCounts), "\n", speciesCounts), 
    main = "Species in Iris Dataset", 
    col = c("red", "blue", "violet"), 
    radius = 1)
PieS
```
#d. Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Write the R scripts and show the last six (6) rows of each species.
```{r}
setosa <- subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
versicolor <- subset(iris, Species == "versicolor")
virginica <- subset(iris, Species == "virginica")
Seeto<-tail(setosa)
Veersi<- tail(versicolor)
Viirgi<- tail(virginica)
Seeto
Veersi
Viirgi
```
#e. Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the differentspecies(setosa,versicolor,virginica). Add a title = “Iris Dataset”, subtitle = “Sepal width and length, labels for the x and y axis, the pch symbol and colors should be based on the species.
```{r}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, main = "Iris Dataset", sub = "Sepal width and length", xlab = "Sepal Length", ylab = "Sepal Width", pch = 19, col = iris$Species)
legend("topright", legend = levels(iris$Species), pch = 19, col = 1:3)
```
#f. Interpret the result.
#The result seperates the 3 species by color to easily identify them and also to mark the locations on where the species can be seen.


#7. Import the alexa-file.xlsx. Check on the variations. Notice that there are ex-tra whitespaces among black variants (Black Dot, Black Plus, Black Show, Black Spot). Also on the white variants (White Dot, White Plus, White Show, White     Spot).
