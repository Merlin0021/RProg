## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#a.Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.
```{r}

mpg <- read.csv("mpg.csv")
mpg

```
#b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
#The categorical variables are manufacturer, model, cyl, trans, drv, and class.
#c. Which are continuous variables?
#The continuous variables are displ, year, cty, and hwy.

#2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations? Show your answer.
```{r}
table(mpg$manufacturer)
#The dodge model 

```
#a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.
```{r}
table(mpg$model)
# The model that has the most variations is caravan 2wd.
```
# a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.
```{r}
library("dplyr")
UniqueModel <- mpg %>%
 group_by(manufacturer) %>%
 summarise(models = n_distinct(model))
UniqueModel
```
#b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
UniqueModel$manufacturer <- as.factor(UniqueModel$manufacturer)
UniqueModel$models <- as.numeric(UniqueModel$models)

plot(UniqueModel$manufacturer, UniqueModel$models,
     type = "p",
     col = "red",
     main = "Number of Unique Models per Manufacturer",
     xlab = "Manufacturer",
     ylab = "Unique Model Count",
     las = 3)
ggplot(UniqueModel, aes(manufacturer, models), y = models) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "yellow", color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Number of Unique Models per Manufacturer", x = "Manufacturer", y = "Unique Model Count")
 
```
# 2. Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the model and the manufacturer. a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(UniqueModel, aes(manufacturer, models), y = models) +
  geom_point( color = "green")
 
 
# it shows the data using dots 
```
# b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?
```{r}
#Yes, it is useful.If it's not useful maybe you can use another type of graph on the problem or you can also add some modifications on the current data so it will be more useful for you and others that will bee seing it.
```
#3. Plot the model and the year using ggplot(). Use only the top 20 observations. Write the codes and its results.
```{r}

top20mpg <- mpg %>%
  arrange(desc(mpg)) %>%  # Replace 'mpg' with the appropriate column for ranking
  head(20)
top20mpg
ggplot(top20mpg, aes(model,year)) + geom_point()
```
#4. Using the pipe (%>%), group the model and get the number of cars per model. Show codes and its result
```{r}
carNum <- mpg %>%
  group_by(model) %>%        
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))       

carNum
```

# a. Plot using geom_bar() using the top 20 observations only. The graphs shoudl have a title, labels and colors. Show code and results.
```{r}
ggplot(carNum, aes(x = model, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill ="yellow", color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Observations", x = "Model", y = "Count of Cars")
```
#b. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show codes and its result.
```{r}
ggplot(carNum, aes(x = model, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "yellow", color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Top 20 Observations", x = "Model", y = "Number of Cars") +
  coord_flip()
```
#5. Plot the relationship between cyl - number of cylinders and displ - engine displacement using geom_point with aesthetic color = engine displacement. Title should be “Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement”. a. How would you describe its relationship? Show the codes and its result.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cyl, color = displ)) + geom_point(size = 3) +  labs(title = "Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement",
       x = "Number of Cylinders (cyl)",
       y = "Engine Displacement (displ)")
```
#6. Plot the relationship between displ (engine displacement) and hwy(highway miles per gallon). Mapped it with a continuous variable you have identified in #1-c. What is its result? Why it produced such output?

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +  
  labs(title = "Relationship between engine displacement and Highway MPG",
       x = "Engine Displacement (displ)",
