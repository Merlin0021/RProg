## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.

```{r}
Shoe_size <- c(6.7,9.0,8.5,8.5,10.5,7.0,9.5,9.0,13.0,7.5,10.5,8.5,12.0,10.5, 13.0,11.5,8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0)
Height <- c(66.0,68.0,64.5,65.0,70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0)
Gender <- c("F","F","F","F","M","F","F","F","M","F","M","F","M","M","M","M","F","F","M","F","F","M","M","F","M","M","M","M")
ShoeInfo <- data.frame(Shoe_size,Height,Gender)
print(ShoeInfo)
```
#a. Describe the data.
#The data shows the shoe size, height, and the gender of the people.

#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.What its result? Show the R scripts.
```{r}
msd <- subset(ShoeInfo , Gender == "M")
msd
fsd <- subset(ShoeInfo , Gender == "F")
fsd
```
#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}
means <- mean(ShoeInfo$Shoe_size)
means

meanh <- mean(ShoeInfo$Height)
meanh
```
#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
#Yes, Because the taller you are the bigger the size of your feet.

#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result tofactor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.

```{r}
months <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
"September","October","September","November","August",
"January","November","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February",
"April")
factor_months_vector <- factor(months)
factor_months_vector
```
#Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
```{r}
summary(months)
```
```{r}
summary(factor_months_vector)
```
#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
```{r}
direction <- c("East","West","North")
frequency <- c(1,4,3)
factor_data <- factor(direction, levels = c("East", "West", "North"))
factor_data
```
#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv
```{r}
import_march <- read.csv("import_march.csv")
import_march
```
#a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function. Write the code.
```{r}
read_table  <- read.table("import_march.csv",header = TRUE, sep = ",")
read_table
```
#b. View the dataset. Write the R scripts and its result.
```{r}
import_march
```
