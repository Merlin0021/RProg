## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
negative <- -5:5

```

#The output shows -5 to 5 #b. x \<- 1:7. What will be the value of x?

```{r}
x <- 1:7

```

#The output of x is a sequence from 1 to 7 #Create a vector using seq()
function #a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2) \# specify step size Write the R script
and its output. Describe the output.

```{r}
seq(1,3, by=0.2)

```

#The output shows the numbers 1 to 3 with even decimals.

#R has actually lots of built-in datasets. For example, the rivers data
#“gives the lengths (in miles) of 141 “major” rivers in North America, as
#compiled by the US Geological Survey”. #a. Type “rivers” in your R
#console. Create a vector data with 7 elements, containing the number of
#elements (length) in rivers, their sum (sum), mean (mean),
#median(median), variance(var), standard deviation(sd), minimum (min) and
#maximum (max).

#b. What are the results? #It provides the nuber of the rivers in
#dataset, it shows the total length of the river alongside with some
#important data with this.
